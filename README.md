Hi, after a sleepless night, I present you a simple game called Destroy your keyboard!, a final project for phase0 helsinki-fox. Simply type every appearing word to gain score, this game also include a background sound, autoplay in Microsoft edge but if you use Firefox and Chrome just allow the audio permission. That's it, cheers.
